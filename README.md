# Vulkan in C, not C++

**NOTES**
This is a template that can be used to get started in coding Vulkan with the C language.

Keep in mind, update the vulkan version number to the correct one you have installed. ( You might have installed Vulkan in a different path then where I did. )  

I included the CGLM math library as well as the GLFW3 version that I used for this test template project.  

The run.bat file is for windows users who want to simply click and go to. It will create an executable. I didn't use make, because I saw no point for this simple test.  

I might add more to this template project over time. Example, I am thinking of adding Assimp.
